## Certified Gopher & Silly Orange cat lover

Hey there, I'm Julien, an 18-year-old developer hailing from France. 

I'm a Freelance Golang & Python Software Engineer. Focused on lowlevel stuff, mass website botting, REST APIs and anti-bot bypassing. 
Currently, I've got a passion for all things tech, with specialties in automation, offensive security, reverse engineering, and networking.

## Current Projects
- Learning assembly and rust
- Works on all sorts of freelance jobs (dm if you need a dev !)

## Past Projects
- Virtual machine
- Ai fortnite aimbot
- Rotating Proxy pool
- Bulk account creators
- Website scraping/botting
- Captcha and antibot solutions / api
- Algorithmic Trading bot as a service
- Trading bot as a service ([trade-matica.cc](https://github.com/Trade-Matica))
- A range of services and software on Discord
- Multiple services and botting-related projects

## Strong Languages / Skills, Tools

I'm primarily a Golang developer but also fluent in using Python. I usually use VS Code on Windows with GitHub Desktop to manage projects. I like to use Surreal DB as a database and Docker to deploy in production. I use Ghidra for reverse engineering, and I also use Node.js to reverse web-based anti-bot protections. Sometimes, I run my MacBook Pro M2 to chill out or work outside of my home (and touch somes grass..).
