Hey there, I'm Julien, an 18-year-old developer hailing from France.

I'm a Freelance Golang & Python Software Engineer. Focused on lowlevel stuff, finance, quantitative trading, reverse engineering, botting, REST APIs and anti-bot bypassing. 
Currently, I've got a passion for all things tech, with specialties in automation, offensive security, reverse engineering, and networking.
